,Biotechnology R&D firms perform biotechnology R&D. These firms are captured by R&D surveys. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For Brazil and Sweden, firms with 10 or more employees only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For Italy and Lithuania, 2020 data are preliminary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For Latvia, this includes medical biotechnology, environmental biotechnology, industrial biotechnology and agricultural biotechnology. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For Mexico, firms with 20 or more employees only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For the United States, prior to 2017 statistics are based on companies in the United States that reported to the survey and had 5 or more employees (i.e., these statistics do not include an adjustment to the weight to account for unit nonresponse). Beginning in 2017, the survey includes companies with 10 or more employees (companies with fewer than 10 employees are included in a separate survey, the Annual Business Survey). Beginning in 2018, weights are adjusted to account for unit nonresponse and statistics are for companies that performed or funded $50,000 or more of R&D. Beginning in 2019, these company count estimates reflect a change in rounding methodology. For 2019, the Census Bureau has reviewed the data product for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and has approved the disclosure avoidance practices applied.ï¿½ (Approval ID: CBDRB-FY21-110).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
